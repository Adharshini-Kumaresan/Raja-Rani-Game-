# Raja-Rani-Game-
A Unity-based game that reimagines the classic Raja Rani and Hopscotch as an interactive audiometry test. Players act as police, tapping game objects mapped to pure tone decibels. Using threshold sliders and timed levels, the game records hearing limits across frequencies and presents results at the end.
