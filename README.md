# 🎮 Raja Rani Audiometry Game  

A Unity-based interactive game that reimagines the classic Indian **Raja Rani** and **Hopscotch** as a fun **audiometry test**.  
Players act as the *Police*, identifying the *Thief* by listening to **pure tones** at different decibel levels. This project blends traditional gameplay with a practical **hearing assessment tool**.

## 🚀 Features  
- 🎵 **Audiometry Integration** – Pure tone audiometry implemented through Unity audio sources.  
- 🧩 **Role-based Gameplay** – King, Queen, Minister, Soldier, Servant, and Thief each have tones mapped to them.  
- 🎚 **Threshold Sliders** – Players set their hearing threshold for each frequency before starting.  
- ⏱ **Timed Levels** – 6 levels, each lasting **60 seconds**, with prompts after 40 seconds.  
- 📊 **Results Summary** – Displays the player’s hearing thresholds across all tested frequencies.  
- 🎨 **Classic Revival** – Inspired by *Raja Rani* and *Hopscotch*, redesigned for an educational purpose.

## 🕹 Gameplay Flow  
1. At the start, use sliders to set your **hearing threshold** for each frequency (5–90 dB).  
2. Tap on game objects (tiles/roles) to hear their assigned pure tone.  
3. Each level runs for 60 seconds, with a threshold selection prompt at 40 seconds.  
4. Identify which tone matches your threshold for that level.  
5. After 6 levels, a **summary report** displays your thresholds across frequencies.
